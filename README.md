# Protogen Character Generator v0.1

Hey! 

Thanks for checking out my **Protogen Character Generator**. The generator is using Blender's [Geometry Node system](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/index.html). 

**You'll need the latest version of [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) (3.1+) for the file to work correctly.**

**This early version of the tool is only for character concepting and image renders. The models can not be exported properly.** You might be able to make a cool profile picture though! I do plan on adding models for the body and fixing the exporting later on.

More features and designs will also be added in the future!

# Usage

**Download the .blend file [>>HERE<<](https://github.com/illegal-ferret/protogen-generator/raw/main/generator/proto_generator_0.1.blend)**

The file has basic instructions to customize and render your own protogen!

Feel free to use the file in any non-commercial way you like. **Do consider sharing the project if you enjoy using it!**

I'm accepting any and all suggestions on designs/features with open arms!
