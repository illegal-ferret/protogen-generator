# Protogen Character Generator

Thanks for checking out my **Protogen Character Generator**. The generator is using Blender's [Geometry Node system](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/index.html). 

## Using the Generator

You'll need [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) 3.1+ for the file to work correctly.

**Download the .blend file [here](https://github.com/illegal-ferret/protogen-generator/raw/main/generator/proto_generator.blend)**!

The file has basic instructions to customize and render your own protogen!

**IMPORTANT! Toggle off GPU Subdivision in Blender's preferences (Edit > Preferences > Viewport > GPU Subdivision) to get the intended look!**
