I'm returning to this project after a long hiatus. Expect some changes soon.

# ⭐ Protogen Character Generator

The Protogen Character Generator is a blender-based creation tool used to generate protogen/primagen fursonas. This is a great tool for anybody who wants a quickly made 3D model of a protogen or primagen, or wants to just explore and see what they can come up with! 
The generator is made using Blender's [Geometry Node system](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/index.html). 

## 🎨 Features

The software can currently be used for:
* Making full-bodied protogen/primagens with hundreds of possible combinations
* Creating profile pictures or high-quality wallpapers with loads of customisation
* Previewing and coming up with designs for a fursona

## 📝 Using the Generator

You'll need [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) 3.1+ for the file to work correctly.

**Download the .blend file [here](https://github.com/illegal-ferret/protogen-generator/raw/main/generator/proto_generator.blend)**!

Instructions for customising your own protogen is accessible inside the blender file.

**IMPORTANT! Toggle off GPU Subdivision in Blender's preferences (Edit > Preferences > Viewport > GPU Subdivision) to get the intended look!**
