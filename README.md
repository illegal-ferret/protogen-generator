# Protogen Character Generator v0.1

Hey! 

Thanks for checking out my **Protogen Character Generator**. The generator is using Blender's [Geometry Node system](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/index.html). You'll need the newest version of [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) (3.1+) for the file to work correctly.

This is a very early iteration of the tool. Currently the tool generates only a head. Performance isn't the best, do expect lag with the sliders. 

**This iteration of the tool is only for character concepting and image renders. The models can not be exported properly.** You might be able to make a cool profile picture though!

More features and models will be added in the future!


# Usage

**Download the .blend file [>>HERE<<]()**

The file has basic instructions to customize and render your own protogen!

Feel free to use the file in any non-commercial way you like. If you enjoy the tool, I'd really appreciate you linking it to other people who might find it useful! :)

If you do have any questions, feel free to DM me on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/illegal-ferret/)!

Enjoy!
