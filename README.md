# Protogen Character Generator

Hey! 

Thanks for checking out my **Protogen Character Generator**. The generator is using Blender's [Geometry Node system](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/index.html). 

**You'll need the latest version of [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) (3.1+) for the file to work correctly.**

This early version of the tool is only for character concepting and image renders. More features and designs will be added in the future!

# Version 0.2 Is Here!
Small update with custom icons (instructions [here](https://github.com/illegal-ferret/protogen-generator/wiki/Manual)), more colors and tons of scaling & rotating!
Check out the release notes [here](https://github.com/illegal-ferret/protogen-generator/wiki/Release-Notes)!

**What's next?**

Currently working on a base model for the body. There's a little sneak peek in v0.2, see if you can find it! ;)

# Using the Generator

**Download the .blend file [here](https://github.com/illegal-ferret/protogen-generator/raw/main/generator/proto_generator_0.2.blend)**!

The file has basic instructions to customize and render your own protogen!
